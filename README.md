anything
========

A Python constant that considers itself equal to everything else. Useful for unit testing and more.

    >>> Anything == 42
    True
    >>> 'hello' == Anything
    True

You can use it to check that specific values in a data structure
have a value, but it doesn't matter what they are,
for example in a unit test:

    >>> [1, 2, 3] == [1, Anything, 3]
    True
    >>> {'x': 10, 'y': -3} == {'x': 10, 'y': Anything}
    True
    >>> {'x': 10} == {'x': 10, 'y': Anything}
    False

Inequality behaves consistently with equality:

    >>> 'hello' != Anything
    False

Even None is considered equal to Anything:

    >>> Anything == None
    True

And of course:

    >>> Anything == Anything
    True

Usage in Tests
--------------

Example: Creating a user and making sure its data is returned.
As the generated ID can be anything, we can't check it's value,
but this makes sure it is returned.

    import unittest

    class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_create_user(self):
            data = create_user(name='Mary')
            self.assertEqual({
                'name': 'Mary',
                'id': Anything
            }, data)
